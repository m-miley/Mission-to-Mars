## Overview

This project is all about Mars.  Data is made available on a local web page using Python, Beautiful Soup, Splinter Browser, Flask, HTML, and MongoDB.  These resources beautifully interact through multiple scripts to scrape data from live websites then parse the data, store it in a non-relational database, and display it cleanly and openly for viewers to see.  The entire process can be executed directly from the web page where the results are to be displayed so that the user can perform analysis on freshly updated data with an ease of convenience.  The final result will provide a recent and informative news heading and subheading, an updated image, a planetary facts table, and an enhanced image of each hemisphere with a title below.
